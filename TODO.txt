Get rid of pullup resistors
Flip LM4040
Replace footprint of voltage regulator
Triple check all the pinouts for the breakout boards
Change the size of the footprint for the big cap on the battery charger
Get rid of the cap on the voltage supervisor (Not gonna have)
Ask Lund if I need a voltage supervisor (Do we just pick a better battery)
Only need 4 or 5 buttons
Consider an actual battery connector (Ask Lund)
NMOS Pinout change

Do you want a JTAG connector?
Should I put in Debugging pins?
I plan on hiding most of the PCB under the 3D print. NO. It's for EE display

For the PCB design part:
Make a ground plane
Have the USB traces eeeven shorter
Place the switch further from the JTAG connector
